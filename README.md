Coffeeshopped Drupal
====================

A starter copy of Drupal 7 including commonly used modules and a zen starter theme.

Anything interesting here will be in the sites/all directory.  The rest will just be the latest version of Drupal 7.x that I'm using.

This repo is really just a time-saver for starting new Drupal sites.  It seems like an easy way to remember the modules (and combos of modules) that I use all the time.

It's also a place where I plan to create an evolving Zen starter theme that contains all the code bits that I commonly use, such as content type-based preprocessor functions, view mode-based template suggestions, etc.

I may create some boilerplate custom modules as well, containing code that I end up writing repeatedly, such as custom search modules, custom blocks, etc.

Stay tuned!
